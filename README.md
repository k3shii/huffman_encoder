# Huffman Encoder

## Overview

This Python script implements Huffman coding, a method for lossless data compression. Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.

## Features

- Huffman tree construction for efficient encoding and decoding.
- Calculation of average code length, entropy, and efficiency.
- Interactive input to analyze Huffman coding for any given text.
